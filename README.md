# Environmental perturbations in complex ecosyste

## Files 
1. `functions.jl` Holds all functions in used by the simulations
2. `test_functions.jl` Tests all functions necessary to run `full_proticol.jl`.
2. `full_protocol.jl` Generates data to plot average feasibility critical radius for a given n (number of species) and alpha (HOIs strength), and proportion of feasible states as we move away from critical radius
3. `thompson_problem.py` Code to generate nperturbations equispaced perturbations on an n-hypersphere by solving the thompson problem

#want to analyze the robustness of ecosystem by boundary composition. 

#take ecosystems with boundary comp mostly negative, and complex. 

#i expect the ones with boundary mostly negative to be less robust
#the ones with boundary mostly complex to be less robust.

#constrain alpha more precisely to make sure that indeed I have mostly A, or mostly B.

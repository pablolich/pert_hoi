Plan for today; 

Fill out: 
1. Problem statement DONE
2. Response to perturbations DONE
3. Analytical part DONE
4. Simulations with all constraints. DONE 
5. Feasibility with all constraints part. IN PROGRESS	
	- add the feature to follow only the 1,1 equilibria. maybe by doing: always check whether the closeset equilibria to 1,1 is feasible, disregard the rest. Or follow the (1,1) equilibria.
6. Think of a figure to see the radius response (average, max, min). Do the simulations again but this time with the new code using hyperspheres. DONE

 	- add the feature to follow only the 1,1 equilibria. maybe by doing: always check whether the closeset equilibria to 1,1 is feasible, disregard the rest. Or follow the (1,1) equilibria.
 	- Do analytics for one species DONE
 	- Run all simulations with all constraints and several species
 	- Only relax tractability constraints in the supplement
 	- Add analyitical curve to small and homogeneous perturbations in 2 spp
 	- Re-write main text to reflect changes in the narrative.
 	- Write code of the things I want to do that is clean, ready for Zach.
 	- Once I find the radius of max feasibility, run simulations with homogeneous points around the circle instead of random.
 	- Run simulations with same alphas: collect(0:0.05:0.95), skip alpha = 1 since the matrix would be singular
 	- Do all the work for 1, 2, 3, 4 species. But only plot the more than 2 spp lines where it can be seen, in the lines of avmag, area, and area vs avmag.

	I have to write julia code to check if the obtain radius is a critical one, by seeing the orbits for radii around the candidate critical

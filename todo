Plan for today; 

Fill out: 
1. Problem statement DONE
2. Response to perturbations DONE
3. Analytical part DONE
4. Simulations with all constraints. DONE 
5. Feasibility with all constraints part. IN PROGRESS	
	- add the feature to follow only the 1,1 equilibria. maybe by doing: always check whether the closeset equilibria to 1,1 is feasible, disregard the rest. Or follow the (1,1) equilibria.
6. Think of a figure to see the radius response (average, max, min). Do the simulations again but this time with the new code using hyperspheres. DONE

 	- add the feature to follow only the 1,1 equilibria. maybe by doing: always check whether the closeset equilibria to 1,1 is feasible, disregard the rest. Or follow the (1,1) equilibria.
 	- Do analytics for one species DONE
 	- Run all simulations with all constraints and several species
 	- Only relax tractability constraints in the supplement
 	- Add analyitical curve to small and homogeneous perturbations in 2 spp
 	- Re-write main text to reflect changes in the narrative.
 	- Write code of the things I want to do that is clean, ready for Zach.
 	- Once I find the radius of max feasibility, run simulations with homogeneous points around the circle instead of random.
 	- Run simulations with same alphas: collect(0:0.05:0.95), skip alpha = 1 since the matrix would be singular
 	- Do all the work for 1, 2, 3, 4 species. But only plot the more than 2 spp lines where it can be seen, in the lines of avmag, area, and area vs avmag.

	I have to write julia code to check if the obtain radius is a critical one, by seeing the orbits for radii around the candidate critical

	I see an enrichment of feasible states in the regime of high-alpha, high-r as n increases. As such, I should run simulations where I increase n for a fixed alpha and r, to see that the proportion of feasible states increases.

	Back to work.

	It seems like tha parameter homotopy is having troubles when the solutions become complex. But I should not mind since these cases need to be discarded. Make sure that whenever I don't find anything it is indeed because there are no real solutions, and if so, just treat as complex solutions
